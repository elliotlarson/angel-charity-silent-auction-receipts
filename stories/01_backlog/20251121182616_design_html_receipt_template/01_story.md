# Design HTML receipt template

We need to create an HTML design for auction item receipts that will be generated as PDFs. The receipt should be professionally designed and suitable for the Angel Charity 2025 Angel Ball Silent Auction.

Let's create a basic Tailwind 4.x CSS styled HTML page.

We need to include the logo for Angel Charity at the top.

The auction items have the data:

- title
- description
- fair_market_value

Other data that needs to be on the receipt:

- angel charity address
- angel charity phone
- angel charity email
- date of angle ball charity event: December 13, 2025

- Signature of person when receiving
- Printed name
- Date of receipt

Note: We need to pull out:

- expiration_date
- special_notes from the descriptions (things like expiration date or special instructions, etc.)
