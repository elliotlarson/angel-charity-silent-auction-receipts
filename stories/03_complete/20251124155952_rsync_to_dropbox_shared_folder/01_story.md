# Rsync to DropBox Shared Folder

I have a DropBox folder for the PDF receipts: `~/Dropbox/Projects/AngelCharity/2025_silent_auction_receipts`. I'd like create a script that rsyncs the `receipts/pdf` directory to the DropBox folder. This folder will be shared with the people that will use the receipts. So, they will give me a new CSV, I will process the CSV, generate new PDFs, and then I'll rsync them to the DropBox folder.
