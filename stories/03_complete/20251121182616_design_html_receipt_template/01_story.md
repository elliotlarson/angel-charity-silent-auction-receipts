# Design HTML receipt template

We need to create an HTML design for auction item receipts that will be generated as PDFs. The receipt should be professionally designed and suitable for the Angel Charity 2025 Angel Ball Silent Auction.

Let's create a basic Tailwind 4.x CSS styled HTML page.

We need to include the logo for Angel Charity at the top: the SVG for the logo is in this story's directory.

The auction items have the data:

- title
- description
- fair_market_value
- notes
- expiration notice

Other data that needs to be on the receipt:

- angel charity address
- angel charity phone
- angel charity email

Angle charity info is in a json file in this story's directory.

- date of angle ball charity event: December 13, 2025

- Signature of person when receiving
- Printed name
- Date of receipt

I want to create an index.html file that references a CDN version of the latest Tailwind CSS library. I want to iterate on the design of the file.
