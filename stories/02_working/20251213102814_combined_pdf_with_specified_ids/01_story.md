# Combined PDF With Specified IDs

We have a script that produces a combined PDF with all the receipt PDFs included, sorted by item identifier and then line item identifier. I want either a new script or an update to the existing script that allows me to pass in a comma delimeted list of item identifiers for the items I want added to the combined PDF.
